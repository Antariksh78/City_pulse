                <h2>Our Vision</h2>
                <p>
                    Traffic congestion is a global issue that not only wastes time but also significantly contributes to environmental pollution.
                    Our website aims to alleviate this by offering users real-time traffic data, suggesting alternative routes, and promoting the use of public transportation and carpooling.
                    The idea is to make commuting smarter by reducing the number of vehicles on the road and providing more efficient ways to travel.
                </p>

                <h2>How It Works</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Real-Time Traffic Updates:</strong> Get up-to-the-minute information about current traffic conditions on your route.</li>
                    <li><strong>Alternate Routes:</strong> Avoid congested areas by finding alternative, faster routes to your destination.</li>
                    <li><strong>Public Transport Integration:</strong> Easily check schedules for buses, trains, and other forms of public transport.</li>
                    <li><strong>Carpooling:</strong> Find or offer carpool options to share rides and reduce the number of vehicles on the road.</li>
                    <li><strong>Eco-Friendly Solutions:</strong> By reducing your time on the road and the number of vehicles, you contribute to lower carbon emissions and a healthier environment.</li>
                </ul>
